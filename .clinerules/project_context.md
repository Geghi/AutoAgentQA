📄 Project Context: AutoAgent QA
AutoAgent QA is an internal AI-powered helpdesk agent designed to assist employees in quickly finding answers to their questions based on internal company knowledge. This includes documents, policies, onboarding guides, and past support tickets. The assistant interacts with users through Slack, delivering fast, accurate, and context-aware responses directly in their workflow.

This solution reduces dependency on human support teams for repetitive questions and enhances productivity by making institutional knowledge instantly accessible.

🎯 Purpose & Goals
Reduce time spent by employees searching for internal information.

Minimize human support workload by automatically handling frequently asked questions.

Ensure knowledge continuity by leveraging past tickets and documentation.

Provide seamless Slack integration, where most internal collaboration already occurs.

Escalate edge cases to human agents when needed, maintaining reliability and trust.

🧩 Key Features
Instant Answers
Employees can ask questions directly in Slack. The agent replies with relevant answers drawn from company documents, guides, and prior conversations.

Context-Aware Help
The assistant uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground its answers in your actual documentation, increasing accuracy and trust.

Human Escalation
If the agent is unsure or the answer requires judgment, the conversation is escalated to a human support agent.

Feedback Collection
Users can rate responses (e.g., 👍 / 👎), helping improve the assistant over time.

Performance Monitoring
Usage, feedback, and escalation metrics are tracked to continuously improve service quality and understand employee needs.
